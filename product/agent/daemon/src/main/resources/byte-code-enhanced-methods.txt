# This file contains regular expressions for methods that are enhanced in runtime by e.g., Guice.
# Such method names must be un-decorated or else the declaring method in the code base will not be found.
#
# One pattern per line.
# Empty lines and lines beginning with # are ignored.
# Syntax: see java.util.regex.Pattern.compile()
# Each pattern should have three groups: 1: the class name, 2: the method name and 3: the parameter list
# Charset: UTF-8
